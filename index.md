### Digital Workshop Series
You can find a directory of the currently available tutorials here:  [https://librarybeales.github.io/dsworkshops/](https://librarybeales.github.io/dsworkshops/) 

## Run the lesson locally.

Currently, the cloud options for running R lessons in Bindewr are slow and problematic.  HOWEVER!  Because R is free and open source you can clone the repo and run it locally in R Studio.

Here are some quick instructions for setting up R and R Studio on your local machine.  Again, both pieces of software are open source and free.
[Installing R and RStudio](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html)

If you need help installing R, please contact [freedmancenter@case.edu](mailto:freedmancenter@case.edu).
